# AORC BMI
 
The AORC (Analysis of Record for Calibration) dataset is a BMI (Basic Model Interface) wrapped data model used to read in and pass forcing inputs to other BMI models.  See [instructions](https://github.com/NOAA-OWP/cfe/blob/master/INSTALL.md#example-2-cfe-model-gets-forcings-passed-from-bmi) in the CFE repository as a general guideline of how `aorc_bmi` can be used. More information about the dataset [here](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1752-1688.13143) and documation on BMI [here](https://bmi.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).
